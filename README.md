# Assymetric-encryption-and-decryption-with-GUI
This program is to create an encoding and decoding project that helps to encode and decode assymetrically with GUI
this is a python program that helps encode and decode messages using GUI interface
simple follow the steps when you run the program!
Give a key that is prime to get best results that cannot be replicated
use the same key for encryption as well as decryption
HOW KEYS WORK:

Encryption:

In encryption, a key is used to scramble or encode the original data (plaintext) into a form that appears random and unintelligible (ciphertext).
The key determines how the encryption algorithm operates on the plaintext.
Only someone who knows the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext back into the original plaintext.

Decryption:

Decryption is the process of reversing the encryption to obtain the original plaintext from the ciphertext.
The same key that was used for encryption is needed for decryption.
The decryption algorithm uses the key to reverse the transformation applied during encryption and recover the original plaintext.
